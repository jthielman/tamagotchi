# Tamagotchi

## Description
This app imitates a Tamagotchi toy, with four activity categories (eat, play, fight and sleep) and two activities in each category.  Some activities will increase the tamagotchi's health in that area, others will diminish it.  This was made for an assignment that was meant to have us practice writing scss instead of plain old css, but as of now the styling is not where I'd like it to be.  When I have time, I will improve the overall look and perhaps add features.
